# covid-portal-scripts
This repository holds the scripts produced for the Swedish COVID-19 and Pandemic Preparedness Portal that are not directly associated with visualisations or the underlying code used to generate the Portal itself. Those scripts can instead be found in our [visualisations repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal-visualisations) and our [main web repository](https://github.com/ScilifelabDataCentre/covid-portal).

#### Available data
This folder contains all of the scripts and associated files used to update the [available data table](https://www.covid19dataportal.se/datasets/all/) on the Portal. Instructions on the use of the scripts and files, as well as how they could potentially be changed to be used for other purposes.
